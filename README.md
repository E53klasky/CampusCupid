# CampusCupid
This is the creation of a new dating web app.

## Problem Statement
We’re creating a dating app specifically for college students, aiming to help them connect and build meaningful relationships in a fun and secure environment.

### Frontend (Ethan, Rijul using React):
We’ll design a responsive, user-friendly interface for profile creation, matching, and messaging, ensuring smooth navigation and real-time interaction.

### Backend (Abhijeet, Anay using Go):
The backend will handle user data, messaging, and app logic, with secure communication between frontend and backend through APIs.

### Database (MySQL, GORM, or PostgreSQL):
A relational database will store user profiles, messages, and preferences, optimized for fast matching and data retrieval.

We use Cypress for unit-testing the frontend of the application. Specifically, the following behaviors are tested:
- **Button Functionality**: Ensuring that buttons (such as the login and signup buttons) work as expected when clicked.
- **Age Verification**: During the signup or login process, users are required to confirm that they are at least 18 years old.

The app will prioritize security, ease of use, and privacy, providing college students with a safe and engaging platform to meet and connect with others.

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!  
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**  
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them.  
All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.  
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
