This is will be creation of a new dating web app

Problem Statement
We’re creating a dating app specifically for college students, aiming to help them connect and build meaningful relationships in a fun and secure environment.

Frontend (Ethan, RIjul using React):
We’ll design a responsive, user-friendly interface for profile creation, matching, and messaging, ensuring smooth navigation and real-time interaction.

Backend (Abhijeet, Anay using Go):
The backend will handle user data, messaging, and app logic, with secure communication between frontend and backend through APIs.

Database (MySQL, GORM, or PostgreSQL):
A relational database will store user profiles, messages, and preferences, optimized for fast matching and data retrieval.

The app will prioritize security, ease of use, and privacy, providing college students with a safe and engaging platform to meet and connect with others.
