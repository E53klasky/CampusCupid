# CampusCupid
this is will be creation of a new dating web app


Problem Statement
We’re creating a dating app specifically for college students, aiming to help them connect and build meaningful relationships in a fun and secure environment.

Frontend (Ethan, RIjul using React):
We’ll design a responsive, user-friendly interface for profile creation, matching, and messaging, ensuring smooth navigation and real-time interaction.

Backend (Abhijeet, Anay using Go):
The backend will handle user data, messaging, and app logic, with secure communication between frontend and backend through APIs.

Database (MySQL, GORM, or PostgreSQL):
A relational database will store user profiles, messages, and preferences, optimized for fast matching and data retrieval.

We use Cypress for unit-testing the frontend of the application. Specifically, the following behaviors are tested:

Button Functionality: Ensuring that buttons (such as the login and signup buttons) work as expected when clicked.
Age Verification: During the signup or login process, users are required to confirm that they are at least 18 years old.

The app will prioritize security, ease of use, and privacy, providing college students with a safe and engaging platform to meet and connect with others.
